            "Someone once said, “ The best things in the world cannot be seen or touched; they can only be felt in one’s heart”. That’s the core idea that gave birth to SriMitra. Our creator Reshma Singh, an experienced Product Manager with 4 years of industry experience, Post graduated from Welingkar Institute of Management and Research, Mumbai, hails from Patna,Bihar.She has always been someone who has been sensitive to the suffering around her. During most of her yearly birthday trips to the orphanages at Shirdi, she met bright young kids with beautiful smiles hiding the deep suffering around them.SriMitra is the result of one such heartfelt emotion to help these loving children. The unsaid suffering affected her to the extent that she decided to work to resolve this issue of food inadequacy. Deep diving into the issue made her realise the issue of an  inadequate structure and trusted system for food delivery that resulted in food shortage at orphanages. Fueled by her deep passion to help protect these bright smiles, she decided to use technology to solve this issue and so SriMitra was born.",
